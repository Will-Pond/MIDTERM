Donut midterm Project

Summary:
The goal of this project that me and Mariah Created was to create a webpage that displays the 9 donut shops closets to NKU Welcome Center and give information about them. The webpage displays each donut shop with a card that displays an image of the shop. When you click on the shop it brings up brief information about the shop with 3 buttons blow it. Close to close the card, edit to edit the information in the card and MoreDonut Shop info will take you to another webpage learn more about the donut shop.
 Each row represents 3 cards at a time and if want to load more cards you must press the load more button. We also created a button at the top to add a donut shop to the list by clicking on can fill information about your donut shop and append to the list. Finally have a delete button in each of the cards so if the donut shop does not exist anymore you can delete by pressing the delete button.
 Moving on to the detail’s webpage it displays the name of the shop and their most popular donuts. At the bottom is the about us of the donut shop and if click on the “To order” it will take to their official web page to order food. On the right of webpage, you see the quaintly of the donuts they produce and final the return to index will take you back to the homepage.
